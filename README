           INSTRUCTIONS
          
The compressed tar file nmtr.tar.gz contains the MINPACK-2 
trust region method for the solution of (dense) unconstrained
optimization problems.

1. Create the nmtr directory structure with

       gzip -d nmtr.tar.gz
       tar -xvf nmtr.tar

   This produces the directory nmtr and several subdirectories.

2. Change directories to nmtr and install nmtr with

       make install

   This creates libraries in each of the subdirectories and
   the execuatable nmtr.

3. Run the sample problems by executing nmtr, and compare the output in 
   nmtr.info with the output in nmtr.linux.
